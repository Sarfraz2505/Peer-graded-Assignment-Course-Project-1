## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


#R preparations

In this document code will be represented to show how the results have been achieved. Set the default of echo to be true throughout the document:

    ```{r}
    library(knitr)
    opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
    ```

#Load in the necessary packages

    ```{r}
    library(dplyr)
    library(lubridate)
    library(ggplot2)
    ```

#Loading and preprocessing the data

    ```{r}
    activity <- read.csv("/home/sarfraz/activity.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ',', colClasses = c("numeric", "character","integer"))
    ```

#Tidying the data

Change the date into dateformat using lubridate:

    ```{r}
    activity$date <- ymd(activity$date)
    ```
    
Check the data with str() and head():

    ```{r}
    str(activity)
    head(activity)
    ```
    
#Methodology and Result

Calculate the total number of steps per day using dplyr and group by date:
    
    ```{r}
    steps <- activity %>%
      filter(!is.na(steps)) %>%
      group_by(date) %>%
      summarize(steps = sum(steps)) %>%
      print
    ```
    
Use ggplot for making the histogram:

```{r}
ggplot(steps, aes(x = steps)) +geom_histogram(fill = "firebrick", binwidth = 1000)+labs(title = "Histogram of Steps per day", x = "Steps per day", y = "Frequency")
```
    
Calculate the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day:

    ```{r}
    mean_steps <- mean(steps$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
    median_steps <- median(steps$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
    mean_steps
    median_steps
    ```

Calculate the average number of steps taken in each 5-minute interval per day using dplyr and group by interval:
    
    ```{r}
    interval <- activity %>%
      filter(!is.na(steps)) %>%
      group_by(interval) %>%
      summarize(steps = mean(steps))
    ```
    
Use ggplot for making the time series of the 5-minute interval and average steps taken:
    
```{r}
ggplot(interval, aes(x=interval, y=steps)) +geom_line(color = "firebrick")
```
    
Use which.max() to find out the maximum steps, on average, across all the days:
 
    ```{r}
    interval[which.max(interval$steps),]
    ```

Summarize all the missing values:
    
    ```{r}
    sum(is.na(activity$steps))
    ```
    
Create a new dataset as the original and use tapply for filling in the missing values with the average number of steps per 5-minute interval:
    
    ```{r}
    data_full <- activity
    nas <- is.na(data_full$steps)
    avg_interval <- tapply(data_full$steps, data_full$interval, mean, na.rm=TRUE, simplify=TRUE)
    data_full$steps[nas] <- avg_interval[as.character(data_full$interval[nas])]
    ```
    
Check that there are no missing values:
   
    ```{r}
    sum(is.na(data_full$steps))
    ```
    
Calculate the number of steps taken in each 5-minute interval per day using dplyr and group by interval. Use ggplot for making the histogram:
    
    ```{r}
    steps_full <- data_full %>%
      filter(!is.na(steps)) %>%
      group_by(date) %>%
      summarize(steps = sum(steps)) %>%
      print
    ```
```{r}
ggplot(steps_full, aes(x = steps)) +geom_histogram(fill = "firebrick", binwidth =1000)+labs(title = "Histogram of Steps per day, including missing values", x = "Steps per day", y = "Frequency")
```

Calculate the mean and median steps with the filled in values:
   
    ```{r}
    mean_steps_full <- mean(steps_full$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
    median_steps_full <- median(steps_full$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
    mean_steps_full
    median_steps_full
    ```

Use dplyr and mutate to create a new column, weektype, and apply whether the day is weekend or weekday:
   
    ```{r}
    data_full <- mutate(data_full, weektype = ifelse(weekdays(data_full$date) == "Saturday" | weekdays(data_full$date) == "Sunday", "weekend", "weekday"))
    data_full$weektype <- as.factor(data_full$weektype)
    head(data_full)
    ```
    
Calculate the average steps in the 5-minute interval and use ggplot for making the time series of the 5-minute interval for weekday and weekend, and compare the average steps:

    ```{r}
    interval_full <- data_full %>%
      group_by(interval, weektype) %>%
      summarise(steps = mean(steps))
    ```
```{r}
s <- ggplot(interval_full, aes(x=interval, y=steps, color = weektype))+geom_line()+facet_wrap(~weektype, ncol = 1, nrow=2)
    print(s)
```

From the two plots it seems that the test object is more active earlier in the day during weekdays compared to weekends, but more active throughout the weekends compared with weekdays (probably because the oject is working during the weekdays, hence moving less during the day).
